# Highlights

## HOC

The main goal of this project is to work with HOC. I use it to highlight some of the articles/videos depending on the following conditions:

- mark as New if a blog post has less than 100 views
- mark as Popular if a blog post has more than 1000 views

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### In order to check the project, you can run

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
